# R3D SCO Import/Export for Blender 2.9

Blender Addon for Import/Export `.sco` model from Big Rigs, WarZ (Infestation), War Inc.
Tested on Blender `2.8` and `2.9.2`

Original code base By [aleko2144](https://github.com/aleko2144/R3D-engine-Blender-.sco-Import-Export) with some implovements to support WarZ/War Inc.

## Features
- [X] Add support texture Import
- [ ] Add skeleton Import
- [ ] Add animation

## Disclaimer
I edit this addon for just to import my old staff that I used to create in WarZ (my childhood pain) into new engine like `Unreal Engine`, `Unity` or even `Godot` from `Blender`.
So don't expect me to add or update `export to .sco` function to work with WarZ

I'm not trying to steal and I'm not support anyone to steal assets from anygame using this addons/tools. I'm just want to export my old staff and share this addons to everyone :)
